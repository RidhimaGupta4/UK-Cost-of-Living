# 🇬🇧 UK Cost-of-Living Dashboard — Regional Analysis 2018–2024

> An end-to-end data analytics portfolio project built on ONS, CPI, and Land Registry data.  
> Tracks affordability, rent burden, wage growth, and housing across all 12 UK regions.

## 📌 Project Summary

This project answers one core business question:

> **"Where in the UK can a median-wage worker actually afford to live — and how has that changed since 2018?"**

It covers:
- Regional **affordability indices** (disposable income as % of take-home pay)
- **Rent burden** and rent-to-income ratios across 12 regions
- **Real wage growth** adjusted for cumulative CPI inflation
- **House price-to-income ratios** across all regions
- **CPI basket breakdown** — which categories drove the 2022–2023 crisis
- **London vs Rest of UK** comparisons across every metric

## 📐 Methodology

### Affordability Index
```
Affordability Index (%) =  (Monthly Take-Home − Monthly Essential Costs)
                           ─────────────────────────────────────────────  × 100
                                    Monthly Take-Home
```
| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| Monthly Take-Home | Median Annual Wage × 72% ÷ 12 (post-income tax and NI estimate) |
| Rent | ONS / Rightmove aligned average monthly rent per region |
| Groceries | ONS CPI basket aligned monthly food and drink spend |
| Transport | Flat £150/month estimate |

> **Interpretation:** 0% means the worker exactly breaks even on essentials. A negative score — London 2024: **–23.7%** — means essential costs exceed take-home pay entirely.

---

### House Price-to-Income Ratio
```
House Price-to-Income Ratio = Average House Price ÷ Annual Take-Home Pay
```
Crisis threshold: **8×** — the widely cited ONS and housing analyst benchmark above which homeownership becomes structurally inaccessible.

---

### Real Wage Change

Nominal wages are deflated using cumulative CPI factors from the ONS 2017 base:

| Year | Cumulative CPI Factor | Headline Inflation (YoY) |
|---|---|---|
| 2018 | 1.000 | 2.4% |
| 2019 | 1.024 | 1.8% |
| 2020 | 1.033 | 0.9% |
| 2021 | 1.059 | 2.6% |
| 2022 | 1.155 | **9.1%** |
| 2023 | 1.239 | **7.3%** |
| 2024 | 1.279 | 3.2% |

A positive real wage change means the worker gained genuine purchasing power. Most UK regions recorded **–3% to –8%** in real terms over the full 2018–2024 period.

## 🔑 Key Findings (2024)

| Finding | Data Point |
|---|---|
| Only region with negative affordability | **London: –23.7%** — essential costs exceed take-home pay |
| London rent-to-income ratio | **100.8%** in 2024, up from 85.4% in 2018 |
| Most affordable UK region | **North East** at **24.9%** affordability index |
| Highest house price-to-income ratio | **London at 17.6×** — more than double the crisis threshold |
| Real wage change 2018 → 2024 | Most regions lost **–3% to –8%** in real purchasing power |
| Biggest monthly cost shock (2021–2023) | **London** — essential costs rose by **+£636/month** |
| Rent growth since 2018 | UK average rent up **~61%**; London rent up **~43%** in cash terms |

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/uk-cost-of-living-dashboard.git
cd uk-cost-of-living-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Generate all datasets
```bash
python scripts/01_generate_data.py
```
This creates all CSVs and JSON files in `data/processed/`.

### 4. Generate static analysis charts
```bash
python scripts/03_eda_analysis.py
```
This outputs 6 PNG charts to `outputs/`.

### 5. Open the interactive dashboard
```bash
# macOS
open dashboard/index.html

# Windows
start dashboard/index.html

# Linux
xdg-open dashboard/index.html
```

Or simply double-click `dashboard/index.html` in your file explorer.

---

### Optional — Run SQL analysis with DuckDB

```bash
pip install duckdb
```

```python
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect()
con.execute("CREATE TABLE master AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('data/processed/master.csv')")
con.execute("CREATE TABLE cpi    AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('data/processed/cpi_categories.csv')")

# Example: affordability ranking 2024
print(con.execute("""
    SELECT region, affordability_index, rent_to_income_pct, house_price_to_income_ratio
    FROM master
    WHERE year = 2024
    ORDER BY affordability_index ASC
""").df())
```

All 7 analytical queries are in `scripts/02_analysis_queries.sql`.
